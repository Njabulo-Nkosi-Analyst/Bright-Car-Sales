# Bright-Car-Sales

## 🎯 Project Aim
The primary goal of this project was to analyze large-scale automotive sales data to identify the core drivers of revenue growth, assess inventory efficiency, and provide actionable recommendations for asset procurement and geographic expansion.
## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes a dataset covering a significant growth period (2014–2015), where revenue surged by over 1052 % to reach a total of $7.6 Billion. The analysis explores the correlation between vehicle age, mileage, condition, and market demand to optimize dealership performance.

## 📊 Key Insights
 * Exponential Growth: Revenue increased by 1,052% in 2015, with a performance peak in February accounting for nearly 30% of annual revenue.
 * Revenue vs. Volume Leaders: The Ford F-150 led in revenue (20% share), while the Nissan Altima dominated in sales volume with over 19,000 units sold.
 * The "Golden" Asset Window: Vehicles manufactured between 2012 and 2014 are high-velocity assets, generating 66% of total revenue, largely due to their "Excellent" condition and "Standard" mileage.
 * Geographic Hotspots: Sales are heavily concentrated in Florida and California, which together represent approximately 28% of total units sold.
 * Customer Preferences: Automatic Sedans and SUVs are the primary market drivers, with Black and White being the most preferred colors (28% of total units).
## 💡 Recommendations
 * Inventory Optimization: Prioritize the acquisition of 2012–2014 models in "Excellent" condition to align with the highest-velocity revenue segment.
 * Strategic Stocking: Increase inventory of Black and White automatic Sedans and SUVs, particularly in the Base trim level, to meet high-volume consumer demand.
 * Regional Expansion: Focus marketing spend and logistics in Florida and California to capitalize on the existing high sales concentration.
 * Seasonal Preparation: Scale inventory and staffing ahead of February to handle the documented peak in annual sales performance.
## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
 * Miro: Used for project roadmapping, stakeholder mapping, and initial dashboard wireframing.
 * SQL: Leveraged for deep-dive data cleaning, handling null values (e.g., "Unknown" body styles/interiors), and aggregating million-row datasets.
 * Excel: Utilized for data wrangling, pivot table analysis, and preliminary trend calculations.
 * PowerPoint/PDF: Used for final data storytelling and executive-level visualization.
